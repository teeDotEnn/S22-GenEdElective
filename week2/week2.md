## The historians

This section will focus on the historical Middle ages.
The period of history known as the Middle Ages lasts for around 1000 years, starting in 500 CE with the fall of the Roman Empire, and ending in 1500 CE with the Beginning of the Renaissance.

It features:
    - Key figures like Joan Of Arc, Charlemagne and Henry V
    - Events like the Crusades and the Black Death
    - Feudalism as the political and economic system
    - Grand castles and cathedrals
    - Christianity as the dominant religion

### What is considered medieval?

Anything directly from or representing people, events or life from the historical period known as the middle ages, from around 500 - 1500 CE can be described as medieval. This word has it's roots in the Latin term *medium aevum* and first came into use around the 19th century

### What else captivates us about the time

Some characteristics associated with the middle ages:

    - Scale: Everything seems extreme in its magnitude in the middle ages
        - Churches, castles, cathedrals are huge
        - Wars and plagues are brutal and common
        - Great power and wealth is concentratied
        - Poverty is equally intense
    -  Simplicity: Life appeared simpler and more focused than it does now
        - The roles of men and women were more clearly defined
        - Feudalism structured society around relationships derived from the holding of land in exchange for services and labour
        - The Church was more unified in it's goals
    - Grandeur: The medieval aesthetic was impressive to a degree that we don't see today
        - much more pomp and circumstance at religious, royal and military ceremonies
        - the pagentry at jousts
        - the lavish clothing worn by nobility
        - cathedrals, halls and castles filled with artistry
    - Nobility: People's sense of honour and duty to church and state seems to contrast greatly with modern society
        - As land owners, nobles were bound to the king and thus to protect the interests of church and state
        - people aspired to be novle in mind, character and spirity as courtly Christian warriors
## The artists
Artists often use the middles ages as a model and inspiration for their creative works. The culture of the Middle Ages can provide artists with a lot of material. 

Consider:
- Shakespeare's Hamlet is based on a Norse legend comprised by Saxo Grammaticus in Latin, around 1200CE. His books, the *Gesta Danorum* describes the rise and fall of the great rulers of Denmark
- Ariosto in the epic *Orlando Furioso* was published in 1532, telling the story of the death of Rolan, a Christian knight. This is based on the medieval epic story 'The Song of Roland'
- James Archer's painting *Le Morte d'Arthur* from 1860 is an extremely romatic portrayal of medieval times. 

### Thematic trends accros the ages

Consider, what do these depictions say about the values of the artists and audiences of the time?

- Early modern era
    c. 1500-1700 CE
    Focus on chivalry of knighthood and Christians participating in the crusades

    Culturally, the artists are calling back to a period of Christianity when the Church was more unified under Rome, and fought in the crusades. It tends to also reflec the confidence of the Europeans as they go out to find lands that are new to them. 

    Song of Roland
    - Emphasis on how mighty the Emperor Carlemaine was (1)
        - Ruled for 7 years, winning lands and cities
        - Contrasted with the ruler of Saragossa, King Marsilius, who doesn't love god
    - Marsil consults his council, as he sees his imminent defeat at the hands of Calermaine. No one offers advice, except for Blancandrin
    - Blancandrin tells Marsil to bend the knee to Karl, turn to christianity and offer up sons, for it would be better for them to surrender all their riches, than to be driven from their own lands

    Orlando Furioso
    - Emphasis on the motifs of the time: courtesies and daring feats
    - Harkening to a time past - ancient days
    
    Gerusalemme Libertata
    - A longing for a time of 'holy' war, calling for crusades, and marching to war for their god.

- Enlightenment and the age of reason
    c. 1700 - 1800 CE

    This is the time when the medieval period becomes known as the dark ages. Gothic is also used to descrive the architecture of the time. Works of the time focus on how much better things are, and how there was a tyranny of religion imposed on the people

    > “[The Middle Ages were a] period of nearly 10 centuries of almost continuous succession of crimes and disasters.” - Voltaire
    > “In this disastrous epoch [the Middle Ages] we will see the human spirit descend rapidly from the height to which it had been raised and ignorance follow after it: ferocity in one place, refined cruelty in another, and corruption and perfidy everywhere…" - Condorcet
    > “It is well known that the inquisition an admirable and thoroughly Christian invention to make the pope and the monks more powerful and a whole kingdom hypocritical.” - Voltaire

- Romanticism
    c. 1800 - 1880CE

    This time period acts as a reaction to the views of the Enlightenment. Rather than seeking rationality, this movement seeks to explore human experiences, and views the Middle ages through this lens.

    This moveemnt that sought out aesthetic, emotional experiences sought to find those experienced in medievalism, through visual arts, music and literature. It romanticized a return to nature and the simplicity found in medieval society. It also sought to explore intense emotions such as love, apprehension, terror and awe, especially how they related to the beauty of nature

    Note that these are not all positive themes, and that works such as Ring Cycle tells the story of revenge and blood feuds.

    Idylls of the King is an excellent example of this, discussing an almost otherwordly beaty of the Lady of the Lake, the intensity of her expression, and the holiness of the experience as Arthur receives his sword
### Medivalism

Medievalism is the examination of representations of the medieval world and whaat they mean. We do this through an exploration of hte cultural context ofthe studied works, the way the author thinks and how they are viased and prejudiced. 

In an attempt to classify the way we think about medivalism, Eco breaks it down into 10 'Little Middle Ages'. We will be focusing on 3:
    
    - Middle ages as pretext: No real interest in the historical background, mostly a mythological stage for contemporary characters. Essentially, treating it as the lore of a world, while writing fiction over top
    - Middle ages as a barbaric time: These works portray the middle ages as a time of unrestrained violence and base emotions
    - Middle ages of romanticism: These works focus on the emotional elements of medieval culture. This focuses on themes of intense emotions, like love, apprehension, terror and awe, with knights, damsels, ghosts and large castles, all the while undisturbed nature plays its role as a backdrop

### Neo-Medivalism vs Medivalism

- Fiction: Medievalism is the fictional representation of the historical Middle Ages, and modern adaptations of historical art. Neo-Medievalism takes elements from the Middle Ages, and decontextualizes them and rearranges and reconstructs the elements into something new and compeltely fictional
- History: Medievalism stays grounded in the historical facts. While it may reflect the times in which it was created, it remains nostalgic for the historical Middle ages. Neo-Medivalism does not engage with the historical and instead uses elements to tell modern stories, taking on contemporary values and ideas, in medieval trappings
- Fantasy: Medievalism has many fantastical elements, but neomedivalism ramps these elements up to 11, so to speak
